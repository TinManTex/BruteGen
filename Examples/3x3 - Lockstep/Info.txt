Runs the first and third word in lockstep.

The strings in the words lists only include brackets to make it clearer on how it's combined in output.

NOTE: This example has a batch_size of 1 so you can see each string that is generated, this however is much worse performance when generating a lot of strings. See ReadMe for the default value and explanation.
