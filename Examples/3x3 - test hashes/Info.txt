Example of testing hashes, the included hashes are

[wordsA-1][wordsB-2][wordsC-3]
[wordsA-2][wordsB-2][wordsC-2]
[wordsA-2][wordsB-3][wordsC-2]

Which for this example we know will generate since it's output from gen-3x3-simple example.

NOTE: This example has a batch_size of 1 so you can see each string that is generated, this however is much worse performance when generating a lot of strings. See ReadMe for the default value and explanation.
